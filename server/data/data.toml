bio = "I love designing software that's intuitive on outside, and beautiful on the inside. Before I learned to program computers, I lived and worked in Canada as an award-winning filmmaker. In that world, I learned how to lead, to creatively solve problems, and to create experiences that delight an audience. Today, I blend that skillset with deep knowledge in functional programming, user interface architecture, and data-oriented design to help large and small companies create world-class software."
